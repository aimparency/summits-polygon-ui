## Tech overview
This project uses 
- Vite 
  - uses native esmodules (simply serves files)

  - typechecking only on build
- Vue 3+ as frontend framwork
- Pinia as data stores

## Local dev setup
After cloning the repository, run `yarn` to install dependencies. 

Then copy `./src/config.ts.example` to `./src/config.ts` and adapt its contents. 

Also copy the `Summit.json` and `Aim.json` contract artifact from the contract repo's `/artifacts/contracts/*.sol/` into `./src/`. You might want to symlink in case you are working on the contracts as well. 

Run `yarn dev` to spin up a dev server.
